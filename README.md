1. Overview
This system is a general-purpose manufacturing platform that allows users to express their product requests in natural language (e.g., “I want a product like this”), which are then interpreted by a reception Large Language Model (LLM). The system automatically executes the entire process from product design to prototyping and mass production.
The goal is to enable users without specialized skills to realize high-quality products in a short period of time.

2. End-to-End Workflow
Step 1 – Requirements Intake
The user inputs product requirements in natural language to the Reception LLM.

The LLM organizes the requirements, asks clarifying questions, and finalizes a requirements summary.

Output: requirements.json (machine-readable format)

Step 2 – Specification Normalization
The Spec Parser LLM converts the requirements into a standard schema.

All numerical values, units, and constraints are clearly defined, removing ambiguity.

Output: normalized_spec.json

Step 3 – Design Generation
The CAD Generator creates 2D drawings and 3D models from the normalized specification.

The Simulation Engine performs structural, thermal, and functional verification.

Output: design_files/ (STEP, STL, DWG, etc.)

Step 4 – Compliance & Safety Check
The Compliance LLM maps the design to relevant market regulations (e.g., electrical safety, EMC, food safety).

If non-compliance is detected, the system proposes corrective actions.

Output: compliance_report.pdf

Step 5 – Manufacturing Planning
The BOM Planner generates a Bill of Materials (BOM).

Suppliers, lead times, and cost estimates are identified.

Output: manufacturing_plan.xlsx

Step 6 – Prototyping & Testing
The Prototyping Engine issues fabrication instructions for initial prototypes via factory lines or 3D printing.

The Test LLM generates test procedures and executes automated or semi-automated testing.

Output: test_report.pdf

Step 7 – Approval Gate
Human reviewers (or committees) verify prototypes and test results.

If needed, feedback is sent back to the design stage.

Output: approval_log.json

Step 8 – Mass Production
The production line receives manufacturing orders.

Production status is displayed in real time on a dashboard.
